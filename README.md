# NeoDemocracy

**NeoDemocracy** is an open‑source civic engagement platform combining **deliberative democracy**, **sortition (random selection)**, and **participatory AI** to reinvent how societies collectively decide.

##  What Is NeoDemocracy?

NeoDemocracy is a visionary civic system that transforms how citizen input becomes policy:

- **Civic Signaling** – Always-on channels for people to submit concerns and ideas (text, image, audio, video). AI organizes them (de-duplicates, clusters, senses urgency) and surfaces them to deliberative groups.
- **Deliberative Groups & Interest Panels** – Purpose‑driven, randomly selected citizen groups discuss prioritized signals.
- **Citizens’ Juries** – Empowered to make binding policy decisions, replacing opaque traditional electoral or hierarchical routes.

##  Why NeoDemocracy Matters

As designer and author Iggy Love writes, “What if the interface of democracy is just… bad design? And what if we can fix it?”  [oai_citation:0‡Medium](https://heyiggylove.medium.com/neodemocracy-redesigning-how-we-decide-e3955c684d8a?utm_source=chatgpt.com) NeoDemocracy embraces design thinking to rebuild democratic mechanisms from the ground up—making them more transparent, inclusive, and responsive to 21st‑century challenges  [oai_citation:1‡Medium](https://heyiggylove.medium.com/neodemocracy-redesigning-how-we-decide-e3955c684d8a?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
